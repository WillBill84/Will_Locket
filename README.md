# React Portfolio
--------------------------------------------------

## Description

This is my portfolio website built with React. Although it is still currently in development the basics are starting to come together. The home page features a Parallax layered image that is triggered by moving the mouse, it has a responsive nav that uses react-router-dom for the page linking. About page has some basic text although I am looking to fill this out more and add some more design and styling. 

Projects page is is set up with a project component for each individual project that uses props to change pictures and text. I am going to add some more basic design and animation to this section to add a bit more interest. Also I need to add a lazy loading for the images as well.. 

the contact page has a basic layout with a form, the backend hasn't been built yet so the form handling will be done soon.. 


## Future development 

some functionality that I am going to be adding: 

• new logo & animation on hover - I will do this with aftereffects/bodymoving 

• projects page lazy load & some subtle animations

• backend and form handler. 

• a more polished design 

• page transitions - simple fade in out on pages link click. (GSAP)

• finish content - about text , illustrations for about page and contact page. 

• custom mouse pointer
